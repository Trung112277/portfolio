      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I&apos;m {authorName}, a Frontend Developer.</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve been working with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node</strong> for the past one year,
        building web applications that are fast, scalable and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like solving problems, learning new things, and experimenting with
        different technologies. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m probably
        working on a side project or exploring something new.
      </p>
    </div>
